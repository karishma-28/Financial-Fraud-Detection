In fraud detection, LLMs can analyze financial statements, detect anomalies, and recognize patterns indicative of fraudulent behavior.\n\n### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):\nRAG combines the capabilities of LLMs with a retrieval mechanism to enhance the generation process. It retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a large corpus and uses them to provide more accurate and contextually relevant responses. In this context, RAG can pull relevant financial records, reports, and contextual data to assist in the detection and explanation of potential fraud.\n\n### Application:\n\n**Input:** Financial statements and related documents.\n\n**Process:** The system uses RAG to retrieve pertinent information from a database and employs LLM to analyze and interpret the data.\n\n**Output:** A concise report indicating whether the financial statement exhibits fraudulent behavior, with an explanation based on the retrieved context.\n\nThis combination of LLM and RAG enhances the accuracy and reliability of fraud detection in financial filings, making it a powerful tool for auditors, regulators, and financial institutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"üèü

The act is still in the drafting stage, and its final form may differ from the current proposal.\n\nThe AI Act aims to ensure that AI systems are safe, trustworthy, and respect fundamental rights. It proposes a risk-based framework that categorizes AI systems based on their level of risk to society and individuals. High-risk AI systems, such as those used in healthcare, transportation, and law enforcement, will require stricter regulation and oversight.\n\nThe AI Act also proposes measures to address issues such as data protection, cybersecurity, and transparency. It calls for the establishment of a European AI Board to provide guidance and recommendations on AI policy and regulation.\n\nThe AI Act is part of the EU's broader strategy to promote responsible AI and strengthen its leadership in the field. It is expected to have a significant impact on the development and deployment of AI systems in Europe and beyond, as many companies and organizations operating in the EU will be subject to its provisions."},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA\nfrom langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate\nfrom langchain_community.llms import HuggingFaceHub\nfrom IPython.display import display, Markdown\nimport os\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n\n\n# Define the prompt template\ntemplate = \"\"\"\nYou are an Fraud Detection Expert in Financial Text Data, Analyse them and Predict is the Given Statement is Fraud or not?.
